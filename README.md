 Complete Machine Learning From Scratch 

This repository documents my journey of building **Machine Learning completely from scratch**, without relying on high-level ML libraries.  
The goal is to develop **deep conceptual clarity** by manually implementing every core ML component using only **Python, NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib**.

 What This Repository Focuses On

✔ Understanding ML fundamentals at the **numerical level**  
✔ Writing ML pipelines **step-by-step**  
✔ Avoiding black-box abstractions  
✔ Building intuition behind how ML really works
